                       There aren't exact rules but It is recommended always to aim for atleast 400 words. This amount of content will give readers a clear idea of the purpose and theme of that post, and to cover a subject in good detail. The emphasis though should also be on quality.

                        They are really the same thing but some would argue that a blog really is a website that focuses very heavily on content. A website is a much more generic term and can include, for example, a business with pages that never change and are always static.
